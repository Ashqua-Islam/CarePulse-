## 🧠 Problem Statement

Chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension require continuous monitoring and timely intervention. However, patients often use multiple apps and devices, leading to fragmented health data. Doctors lack a unified view of patient trends, which delays preventive care.

CarePulse addresses this problem by providing a single platform that consolidates health data, evaluates risk levels, and supports proactive healthcare management.
